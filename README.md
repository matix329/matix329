# ðŸ’» About Me
Hi there! I'm Matthias, a Big Data student. While my studies emphasize data analysis and machine learning techniques, I am particularly passionate about **data engineering** and building scalable systems. 

Currently, Iâ€™m working on my **masterâ€™s thesis** in the field of **MLOps**, focusing on automating and optimizing workflows for training, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models. Privately, I spend my time honing my skills in **data engineering**, **cloud computing (AWS)**, and **technologies** like Rust and C++ to expand my capabilities and flexibility in software development.
