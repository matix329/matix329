# 💻 About Me
Hi there! I'm Matthias, a Big Data student. While my studies emphasize data analysis and machine learning techniques, I am particularly passionate about **data engineering** and building scalable systems. 

Currently, I’m working on my **master’s thesis** in the field of **MLOps**, focusing on automating and optimizing workflows for training, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models. Privately, I spend my time honing my skills in **data engineering**, **cloud computing (AWS)**, and **technologies** C++, Java to expand my capabilities and flexibility in software development.
